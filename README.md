## 🌟 Project Overview

When I first joined the Let’s Get Together community, resources were scattered across a **large, unorganized document**, making it hard to find anything quickly.  

As the **Front-End Developer & UI Engineer**, I built this **interactive Resources Hub** to:  
- Organize all links and documents efficiently  
- Create a visually engaging, modern interface  
- Improve usability for all members
